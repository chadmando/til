# Understand Block Versus Inline HTML Elements

## Block Elements

Block elements start on a new line and expand the to available width.
Normally there is white space above and below a Block element.
Common Block elements are `div` or `p`.

## Inline Elements

Inline elements take up only the space needed and do not expand.
Inline elements cannot contain Block elements.

Common Inline elements are `span`, `br`, or `strong`.
