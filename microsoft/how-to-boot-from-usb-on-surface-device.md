# How to Boot From A USB Drive On A Surface Device

The instructions from Microsoft for all Surface models
Before you start, make sure you don’t have any other USB devices connected to your Surface, including USB mouse devices, keyboards, or other storage drives.[^1]
Surface will try to boot from any other connected USB devices.

1. Shut down your Surface.
1. Insert the bootable USB drive into the USB port on your Surface.
1. Press and hold the volume-down (F3) button on the Surface. While you're doing this, press and release the power button.
1. The Microsoft or Surface logo appears on your screen. Continue to hold the volume-down (F3) button. Release the button when spinning dots appear beneath the logo.

[^1]: I have booted from a USB Drive with a USB keyboard connected.  This may not alway work.  If an USB device is needed, connect after the boot.
