# What *On Balance Sheet* Means For A Bank

When a commercial bank offers a product or service, they may tell you it is *on balance sheet*.
This means the bank controls that products and the asset or liability remains under their control.
This may be obvious when they are selling you a checking or savings account, but not as obvious for products like money market or sweep accounts, loans, lines of credit, etc.

## Why is this important?

When the bank controls the product there tends to be tighter integration between systems and accounts.
