# Change What Happens When I Close The Laptop Lid

There is a setting in Windows that alters the behavior of a laptop when the lid is closed.
Normally, the laptop will enter _Sleep_ mode when the lid is closed.
You may have an external monitor attached and you want nothing to happen when you close the lid.
The setting can be hard to find. 

## Windows 10 & 11

For Windows 10 and 11, you can find the setting here:

Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Power Options\System Settings

Access the Control Panel by typing `control` into the type-to-search box.
Once the Control Panel is open, the fastest way to access the Power Options is to search for "Power Options".
The setting is called _When I close the lid:_.
