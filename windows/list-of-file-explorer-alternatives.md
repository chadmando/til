# List of File Explorer Alternatives

## File Pilot

Currently (February 2025), [File Pilot](https://filepilot.tech/) is offering Free Beta.[^1]

## Files

Interesting features like Git view.
Very clean look to this app.
I liked that it tries to inherit File Explorer's extensions (e.g. 7-Zip or PowerRename).

Made by GP Software.
