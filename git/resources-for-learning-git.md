# Resources For Learning Git

A short list of resources for dealing with git.
I read somewhere that "Nobody really _learns_ git, they learn enough git".
Maybe just enough to git by.

+ [Git Documentation site](https://git-scm.com/doc) Find the Reference Manual, Pro Git book (see this list), and videos.
+ [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) book by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub. Ebook is free, print book available from Amazon.
+ [Dangit, Git?!?](https://dangitgit.com) A series of common git issues and how to fix them.
+ [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/git?tab=Frequent) The most frequent questions with the `git` tag are linked here.
+ [Git happens! 6 Common Git mistakes and how to fix them](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/08/08/git-happens/) article by Gitlab.
