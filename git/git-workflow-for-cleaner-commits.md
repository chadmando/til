# A Git Workflow For Cleaner Commits

Annie Sexton describes _a better git flow_ in her article on render.com blog.
She describes a better git flow would bundle commits to specific features.
A _seperation of concerns_ for your commits will allow you to revert changes without breaking other 
unrelated features.

## The Better Git Flow

  1. Do work and make WIP commits; Don't worry about your commit messages
  1. When you are finished run `git reset origin/main`
  1. Organize your changes into clean and logical commits with meaningful commit messages
  1. Create _Pull Request_ / Review PR / commit to main
