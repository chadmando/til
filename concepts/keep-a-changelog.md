# Keep A Changelog

Changelogs are curated, chronological lists of *notable* changes to your project.
The project could be a pieces of software, a document, or anything that people interact with.
Changelogs are for _PEOPLE_, not machines.

A list of git commit messages is not a changelog.

Based on the [keepachangelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) website, here are some guidelines:

+ An entry for every version
+ Most recent version should appear first
+ The same type of changes should be grouped

## Types of Changes

1. Added
1. Changed
1. Deprecated
1. Removed
1. Fixed
1. Security

## Changelog Software Tools

[scriv](https://github.com/nedbat/scriv) is a command-line tool to help maintain changelogs.
