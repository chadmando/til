# Perform A Hard Reset On A Dell Laptop

## Background

When troubleshooting some issues related to boot and startup, it is recommended to perform a *hard reset*.

This is NOT a Factory Reset or a type of Operating System reset or recovery[^1].
It is purely related to the draining of residual power from the hardware.

## Steps

1. Shut Down
1. Disconnect Power
1. Disconnect Accessory Devices (USB, Media Cards, etc.)
1. Press & Hold Power Button For 15-20 Seconds
1. Connect Power
1. Start Up
