# Understanding Man Page Sections

When you see a system function followed by a number in parenthesis, the number is referring to the man page section.

For example, this is a sentence from the book *SSH Mastery*[^1]:

>If ssh(1) or sshd(8) complains about a configuration, verify that youâ€™re separating multiple entries correctly.

The *ssh(1)* and *sshd(8)* reference the command and the man page section.

## Sections

There are (8) man page sections[^2]:

1. General commands
1. System calls
1. Library functions covering C std library
1. Special files /dev and drivers
1. File formats
1. Games and screensavers
1. Misc
1. System admin commands and daemons

## Using Sections

I discovered there are is a `read` program and a `read` system call from Julia Evans[^3].
To access the man page for the `read` you want, include the section in the `man` command.

```bash
man 1 read
```

or

```bash
man 3 read
```
